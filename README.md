Watch This
=====================

For centuries, people have interacted with technology on their wrist - information, although limited, was available at a glance. Recently the smart phone has driven the technology back to our pockets - exposing endless information, but requiring a greater commitment by the user. Reducing the load upon the user is a driving force behind the burgeoning wearables market. Recognizing this movement, Apple has entered the fray by releasing the Apple Watch.

More than just another "watch", Apple has introduced a new paradigm through which developers can create interactions with users. We can now tickle the skin of the user, respond to the intensity of a touch, react to a change in biometrics, or simply slip into the user's day through subtle notifications. The Apple Watch opens a door to a new universe of possibilities for apps to change the way users interact with the world around them. 

In this session, we will explore the Apple Watch from all angles. We will start by taking a look at the new capabilities available to us as users. We will then dive into the code to discover how we interact with the watch and create new experiences for our users. Along the way, we will discuss some architectural patterns that make life easier, where WatchKit hasn't quite arrived, and some tips and tricks for designing compelling, yet quick interactions.

Come to this session to get a jump on the exciting new possibilities the Apple Watch creates, as well as simply having fun exploring the cutting edge.
